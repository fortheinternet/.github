## Introduction

This organization was made to create software to be used for the improvement of the internet.

- **Quality**: Everything we produce is high-effort and made with love. This does not mean our APIs are immune to crashes, or that we have good version control.
- **Honesty**: See previous point.
- **Completeness**: We finish projects and make them as close to perfection as possible.
- **Transparency**: You own your data. Every piece of code is open-source and public domain.
- **Simplicity**: Everything in this organization is sanded down as much as possible. We try to make our code readable and maintainable.
- **Fun**: You don't have to take yourself too seriously! Everything should be understandable and basic as much as possible.
