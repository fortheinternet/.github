## Introduction

This organization was made to create software to be used for the improvement of the internet.

- **Transparency**: You own your data. Every piece of code is open-source and public domain.
- **Simplicity**: Everything in this organization is sanded down as much as possible. We try to make our code readable and maintainable.
- **Fun**: You don't have to take yourself too seriously! I am not gonna have a screaming contest with you just because you broke production or lost an API key. 

## Planned projects
